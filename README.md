# 01-Code-Refactor
In this assignment, I modified some codes that give user have better view when they look at it including sematic elements
Structure and descriptive comments were added to the CSS file, and the css rules were clasified accordingly:

/* ================================= 
 Structural content style
==================================== */
Instead of using <div> we structured it in a different way
/* ---------- Header ---------- */
         <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <li>
                <li>
            </ul>
            </nav>


/* ---------- Main ---------- */
    <section>
    <section>
    <section>

/* ------- Aside------- */
    <div>
    <div>
    <div>
/* --------- Footer --------- */
    <div>
